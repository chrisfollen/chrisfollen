### Hi there ✌🏼

I'm a frontend software engineer based in coastal Maine. I like thinking, creating, problem solving, and learning. I’m passionate about everything I do, and am particularly intrigued by work that marries an aesthetic component with a technical one.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: GraphQL
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've surfed in the Arctic Circle
